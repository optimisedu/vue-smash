# vue-smash

This is a very basic VUE 3 and Vite game based on whack a mole. At this point it is very extendable - difficulty modes will be added, as will the web audio api.

This is currently functional but I am looking to get working on a11ty as I add components. Currently I am using a minimal setup to show compitence in SEO when it comes to SPAs

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

##TODOs

- Add difficulty
- Add the web audio API
- Add types
- Convert to svelte
- Improve the SVGs
- Minify, chunk and bundle

I will leave various branches for anybody who wants to pick up this excersize themselves
